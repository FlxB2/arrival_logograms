## Usage
the only requirement is pillow  
`pip install pillow`

just run logogram.py, you may specify a seed as the first argument  
`python logogram.py 200`

## Description
i used this great [stackexchange](https://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/137156/where-is-abbott-how-to-make-logograms-from-the-film-arrival) post as a starting point, added some new things and left out other stuff. 
There are alot of magic numbers at the moment. If I have time i will clean this up and use a config file or something similar. Maybe even a simple GUI to play around with the values.  
Other improvements like better clusters are already planned but might take some time.
